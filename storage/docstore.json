Throughout the summer months at the \nConvention in Philadelphia, delegates from 12 States debated \nthe proper form such a government should take, but few \nquestioned the need to establish a more vigorous government to \npreside over the union of States. The 39 delegates who signed \nthe Constitution on September 17, 1787, expected the new \ncharter to provide a permanent guarantee of the political \nliberties achieved in the Revolution.\n    Prior to the adoption of the Federal Constitution, the \nArticles of Confederation, drafted by the Continental Congress \nand approved by 13 States, provided for a union of the former \nBritish colonies. Even before Maryland became the last State to \naccede to the Articles in 1781, a number of Americans, \nparticularly those involved in the prosecution of the \nRevolutionary War, recognized the inadequacies of the Articles \nas a national government. In the 1780s these nationally-minded \nAmericans became increasingly disturbed by the Articles' \nfailure to provide the central government with authority to \nraise revenue, regulate commerce, or enforce treaties.\n    Despite repeated proposals that the Continental Congress \nrevise the Articles, the movement for a new national government \nbegan outside the Congress. Representatives of Maryland and \nVirginia, meeting at Mt. Vernon to discuss trade problems \nbetween the two States, agreed to invite delegates from all \nStates to discuss commercial affairs at a meeting in Annapolis, \nMaryland, in September 1786. Although delegates from only five \nStates reached the Annapolis Convention, that group issued a \ncall for a meeting of all States to discuss necessary revisions \nof the Articles of Confederation. Responding to this call and \nthe endorsement of the Continental Congress, every State except \nRhode Island selected delegates for the meeting in the State \nHouse at Philadelphia.\n    The document printed here was the product of nearly four \nmonths of deliberations in the Federal Convention at \nPhiladelphia. The challenging task before the delegates was to \ncreate a republican form of government that could encompass the \n13 States and accommodate the anticipated expansion to the \nWest. The distribution of authority between legislative, \nexecutive, and judicial branches was a boldly original attempt \nto create an energetic central government at the same time that \nthe sovereignty of the people was preserved.\n    The longest debate of the Convention centered on the proper \nform of representation and election for the Congress. The \ndivision between small States that wished to perpetuate the \nequal representation of States in the Continental Congress and \nthe large States that proposed representation proportional to \npopulation threatened to bring the Convention proceedings to a \nhalt. Over several weeks the delegates developed a complicated \ncompromise that provided for equal representation of the States \nin a Senate elected by State legislature and proportional \nrepresentation in a popularly-elected House of Representatives.\n    The conflict between large and small States disappeared in \nthe early years of the republic. More lasting was the division \nbetween slave and free States that had been a disturbing \nundercurrent in the Convention debates. The Convention's \nstrained attempt to avoid using the word slavery in the \narticles granting recognition and protection to that \ninstitution scarcely hid the regional divisions that would \nremain unresolved under the terms of union agreed to in 1787.\n    The debates in the State ratification conventions of 1787 \nand 1788 made clear the need to provide amendments to the basic \nframework drafted in Philadelphia. Beginning with \nMassachusetts, a number of State conventions ratified the \nConstitution with the request that a bill of rights be added to \nprotect certain liberties at the core of English and American \npolitical traditions. The First Congress approved a set of \namendments which became the Bill of Rights when ratified by the \nStates in 1791. The continuing process of amendment, clearly \ndescribed in the note of the following text, has enabled the \nConstitution to accommodate changing conditions in American \nsociety at the same time that the Founders' basic outline of \nnational government remains intact.\n                  CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES\\1\\\n\n                              ----------                              \n\n\nWe the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect \n        Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide \n        for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure \n        the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do \n        ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of \n        America.\n\n                               Article I.\n\n    Section 1. All legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist \nof a Senate and House of Representatives.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                   * * * * *                              \n\\1\\This text of the Constitution follows the engrossed copy signed by \nGen. Washington and the deputies from 12 States.

The Virginia commissioners, after some \ncorrespondence, fixed the first Monday in September as the time, and \nthe city of Annapolis as the place for the meeting, but only four other \nStates were represented, viz: Delaware, New York, New Jersey, and \nPennsylvania; the commissioners appointed by Massachusetts, New \nHampshire, North Carolina, and Rhode Island failed to attend. Under the \ncircumstances of so partial a representation, the commissioners present \nagreed upon a report (drawn by Mr. Hamilton, of New York) expressing \ntheir unanimous conviction that it might essentially tend to advance \nthe interests of the Union if the States by which they were \nrespectively delegated would concur, and use their endeavors to procure \nthe concurrence of the other States, in the appointment of \ncommissioners to meet at Philadelphia on the second Monday of May \nfollowing, to take into consideration the situation of the United \nStates; to devise such further provisions as should appear to them \nnecessary to render the Constitution of the Federal Government adequate \nto the exigencies of the Union; and to report such an act for that \npurpose to the United States in Congress assembled as, when agreed to \nby them and afterwards confirmed by the Legislatures of every State, \nwould effectually provide for the same.\n                                   * * * * *                              \nCongress, on the 21st of February, 1787, adopted a resolution in favor \nof a convention, and the Legislatures of those States which had not \nalready done so (with the exception of Rhode Island) promptly appointed \ndelegates. On the 25th of May, seven States having convened, George \nWashington, of Virginia, was unanimously elected President, and the \nconsideration of the proposed constitution was commenced. On the 17th \nof September, 1787, the Constitution as engrossed and agreed upon was \nsigned by all the members present, except Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts, \nand Messrs. Mason and Randolph, of Virginia. The president of the \nconvention transmitted it to Congress, with a resolution stating how \nthe proposed Federal Government should be put in operation, and an \nexplanatory letter. Congress, on the 28th of September, 1787, directed \nthe Constitution so framed, with the resolutions and letter concerning \nthe same, to ``be transmitted to the several Legislatures in order to \nbe submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each State by the \npeople thereof, in conformity to the resolves of the convention.''\n                                   * * * * *                              \nOn the 4th of March, 1789, the day which had been fixed for commencing \nthe operations of Government under the new Constitution, it had been \nratified by the conventions chosen in each State to consider it, as \nfollows: Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; \nNew Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, \nJanuary 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, \n1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; \nVirginia, June 25, 1788; and New York, July 26, 1788.\n                                   * * * * *                              \nThe President informed Congress, on the 28th of January, 1790, that \nNorth Carolina had ratified the Constitution November 21, 1789; and he \ninformed Congress on the 1st of June, 1790, that Rhode Island had \nratified the Constitution May 29, 1790. Vermont, in convention, \nratified the Constitution January 10, 1791, and was, by an act of \nCongress approved February 18, 1791, ``received and admitted into this \nUnion as a new and entire member of the United States.''\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Section 2. \\1\\The House of Representatives shall be \ncomposed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of \nthe several States, and the Electors in each State shall have \nthe Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous \nBranch of the State Legislature.\n    \\2\\No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have \nattained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years \na Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when \nelected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be \nchosen.\n    \\3\\Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned \namong the several States which may be included within this \nUnion, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be \ndetermined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, \nincluding those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and \nexcluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other \nPersons.\\2\\ The actual Enumeration shall be made within three \nYears after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United \nStates, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such \nManner as they shall by Law direct.

In a number of cases, the \njournals of the State legislatures are not available. The dates \nset out in this document are based upon the best information \navailable.]\n   PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSTITUTION NOT RATIFIED BY THE STATES\n\n    During the course of our history, in addition to the 27 \namendments that have been ratified by the required three-\nfourths of the States, six other amendments have been submitted \nto the States but have not been ratified by them.\n    Beginning with the proposed Eighteenth Amendment, Congress \nhas customarily included a provision requiring ratification \nwithin seven years from the time of the submission to the \nStates. The Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller, 307 U.S. 433 \n(1939), declared that the question of the reasonableness of the \ntime within which a sufficient number of States must act is a \npolitical question to be determined by the Congress.\n    In 1789, twelve proposed articles of amendment were \nsubmitted to the States. Of these, Articles III-XII were \nratified and became the first ten amendments to the \nConstitution, popularly known as the Bill of Rights. In 1992, \nproposed Article II was ratified and became the 27th amendment \nto the Constitution. Proposed Article I which was not ratified \nis as follows:\n\n                          ``Article the first\n\n    ``After the first enumeration required by the first article of the \nConstitution, there shall be one Representative for every thirty \nthousand, until the number shall amount to one hundred, after which the \nproportion shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall be not \nless than one-hundred Representatives, nor less than one Representative \nfor every forty thousand persons, until the number of Representatives \nshall amount to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so \nregulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than two hundred \nRepresentatives, nor more than one Representative for every fifty \nthousand persons.''\n                                ------                                \n\n    Thereafter, in the 2d session of the Eleventh Congress, the \nCongress proposed the following article of amendment to the \nConstitution relating to acceptance by citizens of the United \nStates of titles of nobility from any foreign government.\n    The proposed amendment, which was not ratified by three-\nfourths of the States, is as follows:\n\n    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United \nStates of America in Congress assembled, two thirds of both houses \nconcurring, That the following section be submitted to the legislatures \nof the several states, which, when ratified by the legislatures of \nthree fourths of the states, shall be valid and binding, as a part of \nthe constitution of the United States.\n\n    If any citizen of the United States shall accept, claim, receive or \nretain any title of nobility or honour, or shall, without the consent \nof Congress, accept and retain any present, pension, office or \nemolument of any kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince or \nforeign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of the United \nStates, and shall be incapable of holding any office of trust or profit \nunder them, or either of them.\n\n    The following amendment to the Constitution relating to \nslavery was proposed by the 2d session of the Thirty-sixth \nCongress on March 2, 1861, when it passed the Senate, having \npreviously passed the House on February 28, 1861. It is \ninteresting to note in this connection that this is the only \nproposed (and not ratified) amendment to the Constitution to \nhave been signed by the President. The President's signature is \nconsidered unnecessary because of the constitutional provision \nthat on the concurrence of two-thirds of both Houses of \nCongress the proposal shall be submitted to the States for \nratification.\n\n    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United \nStates of America in Congress assembled, That the following article be \nproposed to the Legislatures of the several States as an amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States, which, when ratified by three-\nfourths of said Legislatures, shall be valid, to all intents and \npurposes, as part of the said Constitution, viz:\n\n                           ``Article Thirteen\n\n    ``No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will \nauthorize or give to Congress the power to abolish or interfere, within \nany State, with the domestic institutions thereof, including that of \npersons held to labor or service by the laws of said State.''\n                                ------                                \n\n    A child labor amendment was proposed by the 1st session of \nthe Sixty-eighth Congress on June 2, 1926, when it passed the \nSenate, having previously passed the House on April 26, 1926. \nThe proposed amendment, which has been ratified by 28 States, \nto date, is as follows:\n\n  Joint Resolution Proposing an Amendment to the Constitution of the \n                             United States\n\n    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United \nStates of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House \nconcurring therein), That the following article is proposed as an \namendment to the Constitution of the United States, which, when \nratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States, \nshall be valid to all intends and purposes as a part of the \nConstitution:\n\n                              ``Article--.\n\n    ``Section 1. The Congress shall have power to limit, regulate, and \nprohibit the labor of persons under eighteen years of age.\n    ``Section 2.
